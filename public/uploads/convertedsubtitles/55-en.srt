WEBVTT

1
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,240
We really need to get first place in that Beat Contest

2
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,720
We’ll win it for sure, bro, you’re just anxious.

3
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,320
I don't even have any money left. My drumstick is also completely spoiled.
- There, there.

4
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,480
We have Pete. He's our rich guy.

5
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,040
We’ll get you a new one, don’t worry.

6
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,840
You swear?

7
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,320
Of course.
- Yes!

8
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,360
Bro...

9
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,880
Ah! Not you too!

10
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,600
So cunning, I’ll will remember this.
-Let’s move, guys.

11
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
There’s something stuck on your hair. I’ll buy a guitar pick for you.

12
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,760
No.

13
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,280
Okay?

14
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,440
No. You’ll get me an ugly pick.

15
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,160
No, I know a nice one, Dave.

16
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,280
I don’t care.

17
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,600
Whose guitar did you bring home this time?

18
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,640
You should concentrate on your studies.

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,800
Ah, don’t worry, mom.

20
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,480
You’re neglecting your studies.

21
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,800
I’m definitely gonna pass the exam.

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,880
All you think about is music.

23
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,960
Is that chicken?

24
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,080
Listen to what I’m saying. How will you manage to find a job?

25
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,360
Look, mom. I know, I know.

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,040
How will you have the confidence to find a wife?

27
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,000
Ah! I’m going to study.

28
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,360
Damn, it’s my restricted day for driving.

29
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,840
How much is it till PUC?

30
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,680
It’s Rs.600 till the main gate.

31
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,880
Aish!

32
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,560
Get out. Don’t ever let me see you again. I can find plenty of other women.

33
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,400
Uh, can you go for Rs.500?

34
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,360
Fine, I’ll do it.

35
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,240
Thank you so much.

36
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
Sir, can I get a ride?

37
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,880
Where are you headed?

38
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,640
E, oh, you can use this. I can just hail another one.

39
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,000
Sir, how much is it for Khatla?

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,840
That’ll be Rs.300.

41
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,600
Can you drop me for Rs.150?

42
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,080
Young lady, that won’t be possible, you’ll have to wait for another taxi.

43
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,640
Here, I’ll pay for you.

44
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,600
Thank you so much. I’ll pay you back. Sir, Khatla.

45
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,560
What?

46
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Are you on your way?

47
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,760
I’m studying, you should try it sometimes.

48
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,840
Look, we’re all waiting for you to start the jam. See? Get here fast.

49
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,720
I’m going to study.

50
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,000
The exam is still far away and the Beat Contest is just a few days away.

51
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,200
You’re the one to kept on stressing that it’s important.

52
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,040
Get here fast. Guess we’ll see which is more important to you. Come. I’m hanging up.

53
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,000
Hello

54
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,560
Hi... oh, it’s you? Come, have a seat.

55
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,840
How are you?

56
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,720
Yes, I’m good.

57
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,000
I’m Zodina.

58
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh, by the way, here, from the other day....

59
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,960
There’s no need to-

60
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,920
No... don’t say no...
- I’m serious, you don’t have to pay me back.

61
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,520
No, I feel bad... It’s such a huge amount.

62
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,360
Can you please take it so that I can feel better?

63
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,760
Oye, oye, oye. What are you gonna order?

64
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,400
Whatever you guys like. Uh, Dave, this is my friend…

65
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
Betsie

66
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,800
Betsie? Okay. I’m Dave.

67
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,400
Oh, did you write this? May I read it? You allow it, right?

68
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,680
You allow it, right?
- Go ahead...

69
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,320
Wow, You write songs?

70
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,040
Yeah, I occasionally write.

71
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,040
Mm! Do you make music as well?

72
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,360
I... kind of make it... I guess...

73
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,200
You know, we have a band, and if its okay with you, can you send Zodina your demo? Please?

74
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,360
Okay, I’ll send it to him.

75
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,720
Yes, you’re so nice.

76
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,400
Uh, Excuse me, would you like to place your order?

77
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,360
Wait, it’s the other table.
Send it to him, okay? I trust you.

78
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,120
He must have thought that we’ve known each other. I’m so sorry.
- That’s okay.

79
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,920
That’s okay.

80
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,680
Umm, while we’re at it, let’s exchange phone numbers and I’ll call you later?

81
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,400
Umm.

82
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,960
Yes! Thank you. I’ll get going then. Buh-bye.

83
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,880
Buh- bye.

84
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,480
You came home so late, I’ve been looking forward to eating the food you have prepared.

85
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
I made myself free since you’re back home anyway.

86
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,920
Do you want to have dinner now?

87
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,240
No, not now. I’ll have it later.

88
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,520
Big sis.

89
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,560
Hmm?

90
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,760
Boys from our locality keep on pestering me after they know about your separation.

91
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,440
They’d say something stupid like “When can we start courting your sister because I want to introduce her to my friend who is divorced.”

92
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,280
Or something like, “If I’m unmarried, or if I was still single, I wouldn’t mind courting her.”

93
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,440
It’s so stupid and so annoying. Men who talk excessively are not reliable sources of advice.

94
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,240
Ah! I don’t care so let them say whatever they want.

95
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,480
These men talk endlessly even on social media.

96
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,200
They are often the most opinionated, even on topics related to women.
- Hello?

97
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
And the same applies to issues related to men too.

98
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,040
Oh, really? I’ll be so grateful if it is possible. I’m so glad.

99
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,000
All right.

100
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,960
Oh my! You’re so crazy!

101
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,960
Who was it?

102
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:07,440
That was Kimi. The thing is… uh… I was thinking of staying over at Kimi’s house for the week.

103
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,520
Hmph!

104
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,680
Ahoy! Let’s start.

105
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,360
Let’s start.

106
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,000
We have just one week left to practice for the beat contest so let’s give it our all.

107
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,400
Beth,

108
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:56,960
Mm?

109
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,640
I have to leave early since our storekeeper is sick.

110
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,400
Is that so?
-  You can make whatever you want.

111
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,920
Ah, don’t worry about me, I’ll be all right.

112
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,560
By the way, bring home a smoked pork, let’s have it for dinner.

113
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,720
Okay… I’ll be leaving now. Buh- bye.

114
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,480
Buh-bye.

115
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,480
Beth, I left my key on my dressing table, can you throw it from the window?

116
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,040
Zoa, where are you going? You’ve got quite a handful.

117
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,600
I’m heading for my class.

118
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,480
Oh? With the guitar?

119
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,840
Yeah, we’re planning to jam right after the classes.
- Kim!

120
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,480
What are you doing here?

121
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,680
I’m staying over at Kimi’s house for a while. What about you?

122
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,680
This is my house.

123
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,600
Oh, you guys know each other?

124
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,920
Yeah, we do. I’ll come over some day, okay?
- Mm.

125
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
Yes, buh- bye.

126
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,800
Were you feeling lonely today?

127
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,440
Not at all. I enjoy having some time to myself so I’m pretty okay.

128
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,120
I’m worried about you.

129
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,160
I’m scared you’ll make bad decisions because of your broken heart.

130
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,720
It’s just so hard to wrap my head around it.

131
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:31,920
How I have to deal with it, my family... ah… my mind is blank for now.

132
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,240
You need to forget your past and look towards the future.

133
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,280
As time passes, you'll gradually heal and move on from this.

134
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,640
I guess I’ve become something I’ve never even dreamt for myself… a divorcee.

135
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,200
I don’t know how to explain it, it’s so weird.

136
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,360
Being a divorcee doesn’t have to shape how you live.

137
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,160
Be the Betsie that you’ve always been.

138
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:10,320
Be the Betsie that your family, your friends and everyone else loves. Don’t bother yourself with the rest.

139
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:21,920
I know I don’t understand the amount of pain you’re going through but I understand that you’re hurting.

140
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,320
It’ll get better, right?

141
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,360
It will.

142
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,080
Mhm.

143
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,560
Shall we go to bed? I’m super sleepy. But I’ll sleep beside you, okay?

144
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,360
Oh, by the way, my order from Online Mizoram will arrive tomorrow. Receive that for me, okay?

145
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:40,960
Mhm.

146
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,080
Bro, can you tell me Rinkimi’s address?

147
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,080
It’s this building here but I think she has left for her shop.

148
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,840
Her order has arrived.

149
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,960
I’ll just receive it on her behalf?

150
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,960
That’ll be great.

151
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,520
Here, Kimi’s package.

152
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
Oh, thank you. I’ll give it to her.

153
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,960
By the way, I made the demo.

154
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,000
Is that so? Then… what’s your plan for tomorrow?

155
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,480
Umm… I don’t know… why?

156
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,760
We’re going to perform at the Beat Contest. Mind coming to watch?

157
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,960
I’ll let you know tomorrow?

158
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,640
Okay, bye.

159
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,320
Hi! You guys were amazing.

160
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,520
I’m glad you could make it.

161
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,520
Uh, sorry for disturbing you all. You’re the Hangout Boys, right?

162
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,040
Yes. That’s us.

163
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:52,680
E… You are such great singers and your performance was amazing. Let me shake hands you.

164
00:15:53,400 --> 00:16:02,280
Um… I’m John. This is my business card with my details and my phone number. Contact me and we’ll find a way to work together.

165
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,200
Okay. Thank you so much.
- Have a great day.

166
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,080
Where? Let me have a look.

167
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,280
Oh, my! This is MN Records.

168
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,520
Dave, have you heard of them?
- Its among the biggest record labels.

169
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,080
I think that guy is the owner.

170
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,680
I know.

171
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,880
Shall we go?

172
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,960
Let’s go. Come.

173
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,600
See? I told you, you guys did well. He knows how good you all are so he approached you.

174
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,240
It’s only because you came and watched us.

175
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,040
Are you going to stay for a while at Kimi’s place?

176
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,280
I was planning on going home this evening.

177
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,920
Then… let’s go to the café tomorrow?

178
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,040
I might not be available tomorrow; I plan to stay home and keep my sister company.

179
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,440
Okay. Bye-bye.
- Buh-bye.

180
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,360
Zodin, we’ll talk later about the café.

181
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,880
Mm! We may not be the winners but 2nd place isn’t that bad, right, MK?

182
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,040
Mmm. And the contract?

183
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,160
The contract, yeah, we might have a chance to have a professional contract.

184
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,400
Good, good. That’s good.

185
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,200
But, see, if we sign the contract, we’ll have to really-

186
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,400
Hey, Pete, now’s not the time for that.
Come, it’s the time to enjoy.

187
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,200
Let’s enjoy it. Let’s enjoy it. Let’s go!

188
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:23,640
Bro, let me tell you, I love her a lot. I really love her.

189
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:31,840
And she called me last night. I didn’t answer but I really wanted to.

190
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,480
Tell me, what’s going on between you and Betsie?

191
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,880
We can tell that you actually like her from the way you act.

192
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,240
That’s absurd! We’re just starting to know each other.

193
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,040
I’m serious. Don’t try to hide it.

194
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,000
It’s quite obvious from your actions, Zodin.

195
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,280
Huh!

196
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,480
When you had a crush, who was the first one to notice it?

197
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,920
It was me.

198
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,760
Even when you had a crush on a girl in class 10, who was the first one to know it? Huh?

199
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:15,120
I read you like a book, bro. I’m serious, I know you so well and I know you like her.

200
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,960
You’re so a annoying. Anyway, what do you think of her?

201
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,120
Married women are not my type.

202
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,600
If you like her, you have my full support.

203
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,200
I think I’m starting to really like Betsie.

204
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,920
We met by coincidence and what if I’m destined to be with her?

205
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,560
I know so many people who broke up who thought they were destined to be together.

206
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,800
If the two of you truly like each other, go pay the bride price now.

207
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,600
You are so drunk.

208
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,960
Ah… bro. I speak nothing but the truth. My only problem is that I’m so smart.

209
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,200
You just don’t understand.

210
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,120
Such nonsense.

211
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:07,120
On a serious note, Zodin, you have to think about yourself. Once you lift yourself higher, girls will come. Definitely.

212
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,880
You are so wasted.

213
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,840
Zodin, look up at the sky.

214
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,680
It has no limit.

215
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,000
The stars will know of our story.

216
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,960
I’m telling you
The Sky is Ours.

217
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,760
Oh, you were able to make it.

218
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,920
Come sit, come sit. Feel free to pull the chairs.

219
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,200
Oh, you guys seem to run a little late.

220
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,560
We stayed up late last night. We’re so sorry.
- I understand.

221
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:00,160
All right, anyway, we have drafted your contract,

222
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:08,840
Read it carefully, everything that you need to know, like how much you’re getting paid and what we expect from you,

223
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,520
Everything has been clearly stated, read it thoroughly and if you can sign it…

224
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,080
We’ll sign it.

225
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,560
You’re ready to sign? This is great news.

226
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,960
Just sign under each of your names.

227
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,320
Are you all excited?
All: Yes, we are.

228
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,040
You will become a global sensation.

229
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,440
Finally, I welcome you all to MN Records. Let’s shake hands.

230
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,000
Do you want to see your new studio?

231
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,600
Yeah.
- Yes,

232
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,480
You want to see it now? Follow me.

233
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,440
This is it.

234
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,840
Come in, come in.

235
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,400
This is so amazing!

236
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,200
Woah!

237
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,640
How is it? Is it to your liking?

238
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,920
Sir, this is more than what we have imagined.

239
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,600
Oh, really? Glad to hear that.

240
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,080
So, for your first task… hehe

241
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,680
Dave.

242
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:08,680
Uh, hehe, for your first task, come up with an original song

243
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,320
and we’ll try to shoot the music video as soon as possible.

244
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,760
But will you be able to come up with-

245
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,000
Sir, we’ll be able to make it.

246
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,640
You can?

247
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,240
Mm, we can.

248
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,880
You sure?

249
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,280
Sure.

250
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,000
If that’s the case then there’s nothing to be worried about.

251
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:25,240
Now that you have a new studio, make good use of it. I’ll be on my way.

252
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,560
All: Okay, thank you so much.

253
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,680
All: Yes!

254
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,120
This is so beautiful.

255
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,960
Woo! That’s nice!

256
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,040
Ah! I’m so annoyed. Nothing’s entering my head.

257
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,480
What are we gonna do now? You blankly said that we’ll do it.

258
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,600
We’ve already said yes so we have to go through with it now. Think.

259
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,960
Ah! My brain is empty right now.

260
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,720
Maybe we need to eat first.

261
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,720
Dude! You’re such a waste.

262
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,840
I would have finished writing the song if I were Taylor Swift.

263
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,200
But then again, I’m not.

264
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,320
Oh, wait! wait!

265
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,440
Has Betsie sent you her demo?

266
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,200
Oh, right!

267
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,720
Play the song, it might give us ideas.

268
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,960
If I know what was in your heart

269
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,160
I wouldn’t have given you my everything

270
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,400
All the tears that I have cried…

271
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:46,880
Wow!

272
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,480
Wouldn’t have been in vain…

273
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,760
We can definitely make a good arrangement with this.

274
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,480
Come, let’s follow along these lines.

275
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,480
Oh my! Betsie, how are you? We hardly see each other!

276
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,160
I’m good. How are you?

277
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,880
Mm, I’m good. I heard about what happened to you…

278
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,160
I’m so sad, to be divorced at such a young age… I felt so bad for you…

279
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,080
Did I keep you waiting?

280
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,160
Not at all.

281
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,000
You have to come with me.

282
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,560
I’ll have to go, bye, Nunu.

283
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,560
Where are we going?

284
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,640
You’ll see.

285
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,080
Guys, Betsie.

286
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,680
Yes! Come, sit here.

287
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,280
What’s going on? Huh?

288
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:51,920
Beth, we listened to your song and we love it.

289
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,040
Are you serious?

290
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,200
We want you to be our band songwriter.

291
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,320
This is ridiculous! What-

292
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,640
No, our manager expects a new song from us and none of us are able to write anything.

293
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,360
Even Pete said ‘wow’ to your song.

294
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,480
As much as I’m glad… I think this is too sudden…

295
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,040
All right, then, can you give us permission to sing your demo?

296
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,440
Umm…

297
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,480
Let me finish writing it and if you like it, you can use it.

298
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,680
Pete and Dave : Yes!

299
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,600
You guys have to sing it really well though.

300
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,480
Don’t worry, we have Zodina.

301
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:35,440
We will be so grateful, lalthiamtheinu! I need to get at least one girl with your song.

302
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,200
Hello?

303
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,080
Hello, Betsie, you were done writing so quick.

304
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,480
Yeah, I feel that it’s better to just finish it while it’s in your head.

305
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,720
That’s good.

306
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,720
We’re really thankful.

307
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,000
It’s no big deal.

308
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,120
Are you sure you really don’t want the money?

309
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,760
Uh, no... just treat me a coffee later.

310
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,840
Will treat you for sure.

311
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,120
All right, buh-bye.

312
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,960
Bye...

313
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,400
Without time wasted on you

314
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:28,240
I finally heal from all the pain

315
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:35,040
I know you’ve always denied our love

316
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:42,520
My foolish heart was scared of losing you

317
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,520
And now it’s getting late, your time’s run out

318
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,360
There’s no use in regretting

319
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:57,640
You never held me close in your heart

320
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,000
If I knew what was in your heart

321
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,920
I wouldn’t have given you my everything

322
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:13,680
All the tears that I have cried wouldn’t be in vain…

323
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:21,360
And now you don’t deserve my forgiveness, it’s out of reach for you

324
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:27,800
It won’t matter if you kneel, the sky won’t answer

325
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,120
Oh, it won’t matter…

326
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,080
Secondhand Serenade – Fall for you

327
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,600
For our new music video and Betsie.
- Wow! Yes!

328
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,640
It’s gonna be yumm!

329
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,960
Let’s grill this.

330
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,040
We’ll grill this first.

331
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,360
It’s so hot!
- Oh yeah, the sausage...

332
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,000
- Can you get the frying pan?
-Okay, where is it?

333
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,520
It will take a while.

334
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,280
Let’s play truth or dare.

335
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:06,760
Hmm?

336
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,280
Truth or dare. Up for it?

337
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,160
Let’s do it.

338
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,480
Guys, Let’s play truth or dare, you’re all in?

339
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,840
Ah…
- Let’s do it..

340
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,760
Fine, let’s do it
- Yes.

341
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,840
Whoever can’t do the challenge has to chuck the beer.
- Dave, spin.

342
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,840
I won’t join in, I don’t feel too well.

343
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,800
Ah, then, we’ll flick your forehead instead.

344
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,680
Hey!

345
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,840
Come on, let’s start!

346
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,080
I’ll spin the bottle.
-Go ahead.

347
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,040
Ehh! Yes!
- Aah!

348
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,720
This one’s mine.

349
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,800
Ah! Truth or dare?

350
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:36,960
Truth.

351
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,800
When are you going to ask out Betsie?

352
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,600
Ah!

353
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,280
Can’t change it.
- Dare.

354
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,280
No, can’t change it.

355
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,800
Dare. Dare, Dare.
- Can’t change it.

356
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:47,600
I’ll sing instead.

357
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,640
Nah, that’s cheating.

358
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
Fine, then, sing.

359
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:00,880
Watching the sun setting

360
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Makes me lonely

361
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,720
I felt the breeze of the wind

362
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,520
And it makes me miss you more

363
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:21,600
I can't stop seeing your ghost in my dreams

364
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:30,960
You'll never grow old in my heart.

365
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,000
All the way to Europe?

366
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,240
Mm… I’ve always wanted to go there, like, there are so many places I want to photograph. So many...

367
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,520
Like Big Ben and Buckingham Palace?

368
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,280
Those are all in England!

369
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,320
England is still a part of Europe.

370
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,720
It is, but I mean, I want to visit places like…

371
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:08,640
Um, I mean, rather than the city, I prefer the countryside, the little cottages, their farmlands… I want to visit those places.

372
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,440
With a huge lake.
- Mmm.

373
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,200
Take me there one day, okay?

374
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,120
I’ll definitely take you.

375
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,240
Promise?
- Yes.

376
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,840
Tonight has been great.

377
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,480
I’m glad you came along.

378
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,440
I’m the one who is glad, I needed to go out. I’m glad you invited me.

379
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,440
Speaking of which, you might find it uncomfortable to talk about it…

380
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,160
What happened the day we met?

381
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,160
What of it?
- It’s okay if you don’t want to talk about it.

382
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,920
Um… it's not that I don’t want to talk about it…

383
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,120
The person I fought with that day is my ex-husband, Zuala.

384
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:04,520
We used to stay there… and we were married for two years…

385
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:16,360
But… yeah, I have my own faults… it was so hard to tolerate it…

386
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,800
But I’m trying to forget about it.

387
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:36,680
Besides, rather than being the Betsie whose husband beats her up, I want to be just me, just Betsie.

388
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,720
What’s wrong with him? He’s taking so long.

389
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,680
We’re going to be late, try calling him.

390
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,800
This is too much.

391
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,680
Hello, hello.

392
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,920
Ah, he’s finally here.

393
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,640
What took you so long!

394
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,840
What’s the meaning of this?

395
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,680
I asked John to let Betsie join us.

396
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,400
And?

397
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,040
He agreed.

398
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,040
Betsie is coming with us?

399
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,880
Mka and Pete: Yes!

400
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,440
Did I give you permission to come along?

401
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,480
Let’s go, let’s go!

402
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,400
You’re not my boss.

403
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,960
You guys did so great!

404
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,840
Ah! Thank you, thank you.

405
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,760
How was it?

406
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,720
It was awesome

407
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:51,880
Huh!

408
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,160
You’re all tired.

409
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,000
It’s John.

410
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,080
Hello, hello! You were able to perform well?

411
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,960
Yes, sir.

412
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,040
That’s great. That’s great.

413
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,920
I really wanted to come but I couldn’t make it.

414
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,120
Really wished I could join as well. So, how’s Bangkok? Did you face any problems?

415
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,440
No, we didn’t. We’re enjoying it, sir.

416
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,200
Is Betsie enjoying it?

417
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,320
I love it, thank you so much, John.

418
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,960
Glad you’re enjoying it.

419
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,440
Take proper rest tonight since you’re coming home tomorrow.

420
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,000
Yes, sir.

421
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,360
Okay, then, good night.

422
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,080
Good night.

423
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,720
We don’t need to sleep early. We’ll go out.

424
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,400
We have an early flight tomorrow.

425
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,480
We’re not gonna- you’re just worried, we won’t be late.

426
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,080
We’ll be late.

427
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,160
We’re not going to be late.

428
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,440
Drink fast. I want to sleep early.

429
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,600
Even I want to try the street food.

430
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,280
Oh my God!

431
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,080
There’s no point in staying indoors while travelling. You have to go out.

432
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,520
I’m not in the mood to explore…

433
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,560
Don’t be a wuss.

434
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,560
I’m exhausted!

435
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,200
Get up, hey!
- I don’t wan to!

436
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Just get up!

437
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,960
Tonight is the only chance we’ll get to go out.

438
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,920
Where did this guy go off to?

439
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:40,680
Oh, no! I forgot my wallet. I’ll go trace my steps.

440
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,440
We’ll wait for you at the hotel.

441
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,280
Okay, okay. I’ll search for him as well.

442
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:08,960
Hi.

443
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,040
Hi.

444
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,000
So… pretty face got a name?

445
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:17,960
Olivia.

446
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,400
Olivia.? That’s a beautiful name.

447
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,280
Thank you.

448
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,280
So, where you from?

449
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,360
I’m from Brazil.

450
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,240
Brazil? how do you say ‘you have beautiful eyes’ in Portuguese?

451
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,760
Olhos bonitos (beautiful eyes)

452
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,760
Obrigado (thank you)

453
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,480
Can I buy you a drink?

454
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,960
Umm... Sure.

455
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,440
What kind of drink do you want?

456
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,720
What about cocktail?

457
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,360
Cocktail? Can we get two margaritas… for me and this angel.

458
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,920
Tonight has been so fun.

459
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,320
Can you call him?

460
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,800
I’ve called thrice.

461
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,240
Damn frustrating.

462
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,240
Should we just tell John? What should we do?

463
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,320
Ah! He’s our friend, there’s no need to tell him.

464
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,960
The call can get through but he can’t pick up.

465
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,160
Look there… he is so damn buzzed.

466
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,240
Hello, hello! Hello!

467
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,720
Pete! Where did you go?
- I’m so drunk!

468
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,000
I don’t even remember

469
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,800
Where did you go?

470
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,320
I went to club… and the girl I was dancing with…

471
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,960
Turned out to be a guy!

472
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,880
Na! So stupid!

473
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,840
Come, let’s go up.

474
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,120
But hey!

475
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,040
Yeah, bro

476
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:46,320
Zodin, you can’t tell anyone. You hear me? Even you, MK!

477
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,120
Not to a single soul.

478
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,000
Where did you go last night?

479
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,320
Do you even know when our flight is scheduled?

480
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,440
What if we had missed our flight because of you? What would you do?

481
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,760
Are you gonna pay for our tickets? You’ll pay?

482
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,400
Mmm
- You’ll pay?

483
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,760
Fuckin get ready.

484
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,800
What did you get me?

485
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,880
Nothing, I told you I’m broke.

486
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,520
You could’ve gotten me at least one thing.

487
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,600
You spent so much time with your boyfriend that you forgot about me.

488
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,880
Here! Always ready to sulk.

489
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,760
Yes! Thank you!

490
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,560
I’ll put it on now.

491
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,360
Mmm.

492
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,200
Does it look good?

493
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,280
What happened?
- Get me a glass of water.

494
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,680
What happened?
- Get me a glass of water.

495
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,280
Here, drink it.

496
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,440
I’ll get more water, okay?

497
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,800
Come, lay down.

498
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,400
No, I’m okay now. It was just a small ache.

499
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,320
Lay down here… and keep your legs straight.
- I’m okay.

500
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,160
I’ll be okay…

501
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,040
- 00:45:33:16
I’ll get more water, okay?

502
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,000
Mm.

503
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,760
I’ll bring a paracetamol too.

504
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,400
The call is not getting through?

505
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,560
He isn’t picking up…

506
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,720
It’s so annoying.

507
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,640
Oh, sir, how are you?

508
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,400
How have you been?
- I’m John.

509
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,920
You guys are good? Able to reach home safe? Where’s Dave?

510
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,560
Our calls can’t get through.

511
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,720
Oh… okay…

512
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,720
E… yeah, since I couldn’t join you… you guys faced any trouble?

513
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,920
No trouble at all, sir. We’re really grateful.

514
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,200
Did you all enjoy the trip?

515
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,120
Just that Pete can’t different between a girl and a boy, apart from that, no trouble at all.

516
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,680
Oh... that’s horrible.

517
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,840
Zodina was just kidding.

518
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:36,840
Yeah, you have to be careful in Thailand…They all look the same so unless you touch it, you can’t differentiate them anymore.

519
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:45,040
So, Zodin, did Betsie enjoy the trip? We guys would have stuck together like glue.

520
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,080
They say that falling for a married woman hits differently.

521
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:58,840
On a serious note, the reason I urgently asked you guys here is because we’re nearing the end of the year and there are going to be quite a lot of events.

522
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:08,360
You will be fairly busy and our biggest challenge and our main goal will be winning the Thazual Award

523
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:16,840
Even if you don’t have much free time, just remember that all this hard work will pay off in the end, it won’t go in vain.

524
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,360
And if I’m not mistaken, day after tomo-

525
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,160
Hello!

526
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:30,040
E... you... come over here.

527
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,120
Mm. here, let’s shake hands as well.

528
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,360
Hold on. E… you still reek of Bangkok.

529
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:48,120
Huh… just go and sit down. Ask your friends all the important things I said. Tell Dave what we have discussed.

530
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,880
Yes.

531
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,800
As I was saying, day after tomorrow, which is on the 9th, you will have a gig

532
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:59,680
You might be tired to practice immediately but you’ll have to start from tomorrow.

533
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,000
Uh, Dave will also drink lots of water
- Yes!

534
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,600
You’ll be up for it tomorrow, right?
- I will!

535
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,920
Ah, that’s good.

536
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,080
They flew home yesterday.

537
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:11,960
Oh, really?

538
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,040
Mm. Go look at Mka’s story.

539
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,120
Gosh, I like Pete so much, and he’s so cool!

540
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,520
Zodina is much better.

541
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,960
Mka is so adorable.

542
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:26,040
Who should I like? Pete or Dave? But I heard Dave is such a womanizer.

543
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,200
See? Rin, you have a chance.

544
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,360
Go away! I heard people say that Zodina’s girlfriend has been married before.

545
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,440
Is that true?

546
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,280
It’s such a pity, Zodina is still so young.

547
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,320
She went to Thailand with them, like, what did she even do?

548
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,560
Exactly.

549
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,520
Get divorced, he might like you back.

550
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,520
Should I? He might like me cuz of it.

551
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,080
He obviously will like you!

552
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,520
Bro, did Betsie come today?

553
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,240
Uh, the girl with the short hair?

554
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,400
She came but she left really early.

555
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,680
Zodin, can my friend take a photo with you?

556
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,800
I’m so sorry but I am in a bit of a hurry.

557
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,000
Oh, okay.

558
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,440
Come in.

559
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,360
Is anyone home?

560
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,600
Oh, Zodin, where’s my sister?

561
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:10,400
She’s not at home?

562
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,960
No, she left in the morning. I thought you went out together.

563
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:13,960
No… didn’t go out together.

564
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,040
Have a seat. I’ll go make tea.

565
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,520
Okay. Let’s have tea.

566
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,480
Did you enjoy the trip?

567
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,560
It was good.

568
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,160
What did you get me?

569
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,720
Nothing, brought back your sister.

570
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:30,800
I really wanted to come as well.

571
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,720
Did you talk to Pete for me?

572
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:38,720
Pete? He doesn’t care about these things. You have to act first.

573
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,280
I’m too shy to talk to him!

574
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,520
You shouldn’t be shy!

575
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,720
I thought you’d say something to him at least.

576
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,360
I’ll tell him if I don’t forget it.
- Mmm.

577
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,560
Mm. I’ll go take care of the laundry.

578
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,200
Bah!

579
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,000
Oi! You scared me!

580
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,920
Hello

581
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:04,520
Hi!

582
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,600
Where did you go today?

583
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,560
To the café.

584
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,120
I came to the café but you weren’t there.

585
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,120
I didn’t feel good so I went home early.

586
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,640
If that’s the case then you should’ve told me…

587
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,840
You didn’t even pick up the call.

588
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,720
You feel better now?

589
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,200
Yeah, much better.

590
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,840
Then… have dinner at my place?

591
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,160
Mom’s away, travelling and… I’ll be the chef for the night.

592
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,560
I’m scared to taste your cooking

593
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,960
Fine, don’t come and eat.

594
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,560
Hey, I was kidding! Where are you even going?

595
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,840
What are you doing here, Mk?

596
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,720
My family told me to buy some groceries. What about you?

597
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,600
I’m having Betsie over for dinner

598
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,040
That’s gonna be fun.

599
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,120
Don’t forget the jam on Friday.

600
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:18,840
Yeah, yeah.

601
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,280
Thank you. Mk, take your salary on your way out.

602
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,560
Hi
- Hello

603
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,560
Come on in.

604
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,160
You look amazing.

605
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,960
That’s so nice of you to say.

606
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:55,920
Come.

607
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,920
Let me get the chair for you.

608
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,240
Are you hungry?

609
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,680
Not much, I ate something earlier.

610
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,520
Very well then.

611
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,480
I was kidding!

612
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,440
So what are you making?

613
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,280
You’ll know it once I finish making it.

614
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,360
Are you actually pissed off?

615
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,400
No I’m not.

616
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,520
You are!

617
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,960
You’re so irritating!

618
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,840
Tom or Jerry?

619
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,120
Jerry.

620
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,520
I prefer Tom

621
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,840
Hmph! Just because I don’t choose him.

622
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:57,920
Jerry always disturbs Tom while he is minding his own business, and Jerry always wins in the end.

623
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,560
Don’t you feel sad for him?

624
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,920
Just think about it, all that Jerry does is search for food

625
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,240
And Tom always bullies him.

626
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,080
I want to be like Tom and Jerry

627
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,440
Why?

628
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,400
Even though they always fight, they never leave each other.

629
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,720
I’ll be Jerry and you’ll be Tom.

630
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,680
I like spending time together like this.

631
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,560
We hardly have time to spend with each other.

632
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,000
You missed me a lot then?

633
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,240
Of course I do. You don’t miss me?

634
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,120
Did I say I don’t? Huh?

635
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,120
All good?

636
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,320
I’ll just go to the bathroom.

637
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,600
Hello?

638
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,680
Mm... I’ll come over. Hmm... okay buh-bye.

639
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,800
Guys, I have to move.

640
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,560
Where the heck are you going? Our gig is tomorrow!

641
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,200
Who cares? We already know the song, won’t make mistakes.

642
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,080
I’m in a hurry and it’s important, so I’ll leave. Goodnight!

643
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,240
Ah! He killed my spirit.

644
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,640
We’ll wrap it up for now?

645
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,840
We’ll come to practice early tomorrow for the rehearsal, that okay Mk?

646
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,960
Fine, let’s do that.

647
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,760
Look at Lilac

648
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,320
She’s singing so great tonight.

649
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,400
Le, le, le, le, are we ready?

650
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,840
Why do we look so gloomy? And where is Dave?

651
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,680
He’s on his way, John.

652
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,960
He is just on his way? What’s going on!?

653
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,680
Uh… he’s stuck in traffic.

654
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,120
There’s no traffic jam at this hour.

655
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:26,640
Mm. I’ll cancel the gig if he doesn’t reach here within 20 minutes. Call him right now!

656
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,240
Call him!

657
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,880
He’s finally here.

658
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,520
What took you so long?

659
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,640
Guys.

660
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,680
Are you drunk!?

661
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,920
I’m here anyway!

662
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,560
Sober up! We’re going to start.

663
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,040
Always shouting at me whenever--

664
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,560
I’m haven’t shouted at you enough! Look at yourself!

665
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,840
Why do I have to look at myself? Look at yourself instead!

666
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,280
I swear I’ll-

667
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,800
They’ve called our name, let’s go first.

668
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:19,200
Without time wasted on you

669
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:27,720
I finally heal from all the pain

670
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:35,040
I know you’ve always denied our love

671
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:41,320
My foolish heart was scared of losing you

672
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:47,400
And now it’s getting late, your time’s run out

673
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:51,000
There’s no use in regretting

674
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:57,840
You never held me close in your heart

675
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,920
If I knew what-

676
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,440
Continue playing the song, do it.

677
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,920
Look at Dave!

678
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,040
He looks so drunk.

679
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,120
Dave!

680
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,760
-
Dave! The fuck is going with you?

681
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,600
It was a minor mistake. Sorry.

682
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,600
You embarrassed us out there!

683
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,680
I said I’m sorry…

684
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,320
You’re sorry? How many times have I told you to fix yourself?

685
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:37,200
As if you have never done anything wrong. Don’t think you’re at the top just because you’re the band leader.

686
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,480
How dare you!

687
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,560
Hey! Stop it!

688
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,640
Let me go!

689
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,640
Enough, enough.

690
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:46,080
Let me tell you. You’re not going to find a better guitarist than me for this band.

691
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:46,800
Hey! Hey!

692
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,120
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

693
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,560
Do you have no shame? There are so many people around!

694
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,600
Making such a huge ruckus.
- Dave, Dave, Dave!

695
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,760
Run after Dave. Go! Run after him now!

696
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,760
You can’t get through to Dave?

697
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,400
Look at this.

698
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,240
You know that you have breached the contract right?

699
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,920
We’re sorry, John.

700
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,400
Saying sorry doesn’t fix anything.

701
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:52,280
Think about it. You were going to be at the peak of your fame.

702
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:56,200
-
Mistakes can cause dire consequences.

703
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:02,800
We’re coming up with a new song, we’ll recover.

704
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,360
You’ll have a new song?

705
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,200
But what of Dave?

706
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,840
What did John say?

707
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,840
He made me sign a settlement agreement for the breach of contract.

708
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:53,920
He gave us time to get everything sorted out but we can’t do it without Dave.

709
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,600
Where’s Pete?

710
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,120
His family called him so he left.

711
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,800
You’re not gonna go home yet?

712
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,520
Mm. I’ll stay for a while.

713
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,680
Zo, does this mean we have disbanded?

714
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:26,520
I’ve never mentioned this, but, I never had anything…

715
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:33,360
the things I’ve said about my parents, they were all lies

716
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,800
I never got a chance to see them…

717
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:48,440
My uncle took care of me… I make up these lies to fit in.

718
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,800
Then I get to have such great friends in college

59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.200
And now, you guys are not just friends, you’re my only family,

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.240
I’m losing the only family that I have.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:17.000
You go ahead, I’ll stay for a while.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:05.360
How are you, Betsie?

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.600
What do you want?

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:11.040
Don’t you miss me at all? We haven’t spoken for ages.

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.520
We have been separated for so long now, Zuala, why do you continue bothering me?

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:20.520
We haven’t even signed our divorce papers yet. You’re still my wife by law.

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:24.120
I’d rather choose death than be your wife.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:29.960
Do you think you’ll be able to honour vows when you can’t even honour ours?

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:33.120
And you’re saying that you’re dating a celebrity.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.160
Do you know how others are talking behind your back?

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.680
People are gossiping about the fact that we’re separated.

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:43.560
I do not owe you anything. Being married to you was worse than hell.

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:47.320
Zodina is a much better man than you’ll ever be.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.840
And you? You’re nothing. You’re nothing but a man who beats his wife up.

01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:55.360
Marrying you was the worst decision of my life.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.400
I’d rather stay a divorcee than bring you back into my life.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.080
Damn bitch.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:04.440
Slap me if you dare! Do you think I’m still scared of you? I’m not intimidated by you in the least.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:07.960
I’m not even your wife anymore, don’t ever show your face in front of me again.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.480
Feli, where is your sister?

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:21.240
She’s upstairs. You can go upstairs.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:36.400
Zo…

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.800
Where were you today? Why didn’t you answer my calls?

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.320
I went to the bazaar.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.400
Who is this man?

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.600
Zo, it’s not what you think-
Who is he?

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.760
Who!?

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:54.880
That’s Zuala, my ex-husband.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:59.680
Beth, you want to go back to your husband after all that we’ve been through?

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.800
I’m telling you the truth, there is nothing between us.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:09.440
I want to believe you. I really want to believe you, but I can’t.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:15.240
Don’t say whatever you want based on assumptions.

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.680
Then tell me what I don’t know!

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.360
All those times we’ve spent together, were they lies?

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.560
Stop talking, Zodinsang!

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:24.400
There is nothing between me and Zuala.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.200
I faced him with  every strength I had only because of you.

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.160
You should have told me that you met him. You should’ve told me!

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:36.880
I’ve always wanted to tell you! There is nothing between me and him.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:42.480
I didn’t want my past to interfere with us, so I wanted to resolve things on my own… now I’ve resolved it, it’s done.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.760
Beth…

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.800
Zo, please leave me alone for now.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.440
Sis, all good?

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:14.000
Good. I’m going to my room, don’t disturb me.

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:55.640
Zodin, what are you doing?
My sister’s in her room, go.

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:14.760
The blue moon and the stars count the tears I’ve cried

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:22.920
My tears will merge with the rain that has kissed the earth

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:31.800
My sorrow stayed even as the sun went down

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:39.440
And I’ll lie down without owning happiness

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:47.720
Please, don’t give me hope

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:55.720
Watch me as I fall from giving up…

01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:03.680
Don’t let your heart ache because of me

01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:10.920
Don’t let the voice of this hopeless person reach your ears,

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:21.560
Lay me down so I can heal

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:56.600
Let’s not keep any more secrets between us,

01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:01.120
be it our personal problems or whatever problems we may have…

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.080
let’s face them together.

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:10.640
Zo… I find this so hard to tell you…

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:15.680
I told you, no more secrets.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.960
What is it that you’re hiding from me?

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.080
I can’t tell you.

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:31.640
Why can’t you?

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.240
I can’t.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:36.480
Please tell me, Beth.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:40.720
Tell me.

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:50.440
Zo, I don’t have much time to live.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:52.400
What are you saying?

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.040
I have cancer.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:03.960
We received the news from my tests last week and its stage 4.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:12.640
Zo, please forgive me.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:17.320
I don’t want you to suffer because of my disease.

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:27.600
But I can’t do it… I can’t take it anymore, I need you.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:33.240
I want you… I need you by my side…

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:50.520
One by one, you take everyone I love away from me…

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:55.760
Why Betsie?

01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:00.760
Why her?

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:12.320
Please, God, don’t take her from me.

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:29.000
You’re home, dear.

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.200
I came home a while back.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.160
Why do you look so unhappy?

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.400
It’s nothing, mom, I’m good.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.240
Come, sit with me, dear.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.360
I’m your mother and I know you well, so tell me, son.

01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:04.160
Mom… Betsie has cancer.

01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.880
I don’t know what I’m going to do.

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.680
I’m so sorry.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.680
I’m helpless, mom.

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:24.480
Don’t worry, dear, everything will be okay.

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:28.080
Why does God give only to take it away?

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:33.600
Never say that again. God’s plan is always directed towards what’s best for us.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:40.800
Nothing is meant to stay forever, everything has its time.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:47.240
Rather than grieving for what is lost, we should be grateful for the brief moment that we had it.

01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:54.440
Now go spend as much time as you can with Betsie, and don’t think about the rest, okay?

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:18.680
Is anyone home?

01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:23.000
Oh? Come inside. Oi! This is a surprise.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.160
What are you doing?

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.520
I was just cleaning the house.

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.560
You didn’t you tell me beforehand…

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.280
I want to show you something.

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:33.640
What is it?

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:40.440
We’re going to Europe?

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.480
Yes!

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.280
I promised you., didn’t I?

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:49.440
Promise
- Promise

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:11.120
Out of everybody, you’re the only one I want

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:17.560
Oh, it been you and only you

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:24.360
Let’s swear on our lives and promise to stay together

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:30.920
I love staying in your arms

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:37.920
If Pete and Mk were here, they’d chase each other by now.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:41.720
Pete would be in some sort of accident by now.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:46.520
And Dave? Did you guys talk?

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.120
Mmm.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:59.200
Hmm, you need to be the bigger person in this situation. Talk to him when we go home, okay?
We vowed to never take back our promises

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.520
I don’t know.

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:02.560
It’ll all work out.

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:27.920
Hold my hand tight, never let go

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:34.560
We vowed to never take back our promises

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:41.120
Even when we’re lain side by side to return to earth

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:50.920
Together we’ll soar and find our place in the sky

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:37.360
Beth…

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.720
Mm?

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.520
Can you give me your phone?

01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:44.720
Go stand over there, I’ll take your photo.

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:50.200
Beth… will you marry me?

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:58.680
Zodin… Are you sure you made the right decision?

01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:07.520
I don’t know how we’ll meet in the sky…

01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:11.560
so the time that we have now, I want to spend them with you.

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:24.160
Yeah… they say that everyone, even our loved ones roam the sky… So it’s also ours.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.920
You won’t like heaven without me anyway.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.280
You’re not trying to make me live long, aren’t you?

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.640
Hi, Zodin, I need to talk to Betsie’s family.

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:33.960
It’s just me today.

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:36.000
Can I talk to you regarding Betsie?

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:36.640
Of course.

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:45.680
We’re doing our best but we believe Betsie may not have much time left…

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:53.760
The cancer has spread extensively and has caused significant damage. Her condition is unpredictable, so you have to prepare yourself for the worst.

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:58.240
Make sure that she spend her remaining days filled with happiness.

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:01.160
Where did you go?

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:03.480
I went to the shop… how do you feel?

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.040
I’m fine...

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:09.360
Really?

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:14.000
Mm. But I’m so tired of being in the hospital.

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.440
Do you want ot get fresh air?

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.200
Mm.

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:23.120
Get enough rest first, and then we’ll go out.

01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:27.520
I want to climb a mountain.

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.240
You want to climb a mountain?

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:30.160
Mm.

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.440
Which mountain do you want to go to?

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:35.840
A really nice mountain.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.480
Take me there later, okay?

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.960
Do you feel peaceful? scared?

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:40.720
No, I’m not scared, but…

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:49.720
When I have to leave, I don’t want to see you in pain…

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:06.080
If our loved ones are hurt, the person who loves also gets hurt…

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:07.440
Zo…

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:09.440
Hmm?

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:16.880
I want you to be happy even when I leave…

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:26.160
besides, when our days on earth have drawn to a close, the sky is ours. I’ll wait for you.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.520
Are you in touch with Dave?

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:40.800
He’s out of touch with everyone these days, wonder what’s wrong with him.

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:46.880
Yes, Zodin? Yeah… what?

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.160
Okay… all right.

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:53.160
Betsie’s condition got worse, we need to leave now.

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:57.600
Oh, really? Wait, let me just update Dave.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.400
Yeah, hello?

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.200
Am I late?

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.800
Not late at all. How are you?

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:10.640
I’m good.

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:14.960
My sister told me to give this to you before she passed away.

01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:58.160
Hello...

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:06.320
If you’ve watching this video, it means I would’ve passed away.

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:16.640
I wanted to make a short video before my disease eats me up...

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:33.480
Zodin, I told you not to be lonely and miserable. Look at your face now... I told you I can’t stand you being lonely...

01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:58.880
but... whenever you miss me or want to talk to me or want to see my face...just look up at the sky... I’ll be up in the heavens that time... I’ll look over you from above...

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:21.240
Don’t feel alone... you have your friends with you, I’ll be here if you ever want to talk... all you have to do is look up... this is so hard...

01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:43.880
Even the others... Dave, life is great isn’t it? Enjoy all you want but know that your friends love you so much...

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:54.560
Don’t take all the burden to yourself... please remember that your friends are like your family, you can confide in them

01:30:54.760 --> 01:31:04.160
and I know how much you love them and need them... so... stick close to them...

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:13.800
Mk... look at your friends, none of them are happy...

01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:19.600
and none of them will be happy without you, so keep on being the sunshine... it’s your responsibility now.

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:25.240
never forget that your friends are your family...

01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:32.560
and finally, Pete, don’t think that I’ve missed you out, I didn’t forget you.

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:44.840
I know you don’t talk a lot but never forget how precious you are to your friends...

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:51.720
the four of you need each other so never turn your back on each other.

01:31:52.080 --> 01:32:14.200
Zodin, everything that I had been though... you made me forget my worst memories by spending time with you... I’m so grateful.. but I’m sorry...

01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:34.000
I wish I could stay with you forever... I wrote a song for you... and its in this pendrive... please listen to it and I hope you like it...

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:56.040
and... Zodin... even though our time was short, you’ve made it my heaven on earth and thank you for leaving me with no regrets... thank you for loving me, and you know that I love you too...

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:15.000
For tonight’s Thazual Award performance, we’ll call to the stage the youth sensation. They have been the chart toppers for quite a while

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:27.080
and they have left their marks not just in Mizoram but abroad as well, let’s call out The Hangout Boys. They’re dedicating this song to Betsie who had passed away.
