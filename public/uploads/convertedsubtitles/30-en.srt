00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:57.945
Why not call it
the Big Chill or the Nippy era?

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.240
I'm just sayin',
how do we know it's an ice age?

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:04.034
Because of all the ice.

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:08.914
Well, things just got a little chillier.

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:12.751
Help. Help.

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:16.255
Come on, kids, let's go.
The traffic's movin'.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.507
But, but, but, Dad.

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:21.593
No buts. You can play extinction later.

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.680
OK. Come on, guys.

00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:27.474
So, where's Eddie?

00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:31.436
He said he was on the verge
of an evolutionary breakthrough.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:32.938
Really?

00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:36.858
l'm flying.

00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:39.736
Some breakthrough.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:43.699
- Look out.
- You're going the wrong way.

00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:46.660
Crazy mammoth.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.380
Do the world a favor.
Move your issues off the road.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.135
lf my trunk was that small,
l wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.596
Give me a break.
We've been waddlin' all day.

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.435
Go ahead. Follow the crowd.

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:14.021
lt'll be quieter when you're gone.

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:18.275
Come on. lf he wants to
freeze to death, let him.

00:05:27.952 --> 00:05:30.078
l'm up. l'm up.

00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:37.836
Rise and shine, everybody.
Huh? Zak? Marshall?

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.672
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:47.429
Where is everybody? Come on, guys,
we're gonna miss the migration.

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.436
They left without me.
They do this every year.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:59.274
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:04.196
lsn't there anyone who cares
about Sid the Sloth?

00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:08.992
All right, l'll just go by myself.

00:06:11.662 --> 00:06:13.205
Sick.

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:16.083
Wide body, curb it next time.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.585
Oh, jeez. Yuck.

00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:24.674
l can't believe it. Fresh wild greens.
Frank, where did you ever...?

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.886
- Go ahead. Dig in.
- A dandelion.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.598
- l thought the frost wiped 'em all out.
- All but one.

00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:36.812
lt makes me so... l wanna... Yuck.

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:41.691
This has definitely not been my day.
You know what l'm sayin', buddy?

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:45.570
What a mess. You rhinos
have tiny brains. Did you know that?

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:50.659
lt's just a fact. No offense. You probably
didn't even know what l'm talkin' about.

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:52.786
Yummo.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.039
A dandelion. Must be
the last one of the season.

00:06:59.043 --> 00:07:01.294
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:03.505
He ruined our salad.

00:07:05.007 --> 00:07:08.093
My mistake.
That was my mistake. Let me...

00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:11.930
No, no, seriously, let me
take care of this. What is this?

00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:15.725
Pine cones. Oh, my goodness.
They're my favorite.

00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:22.315
Delicious. That's good eating.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.861
But don't let me hog them all up.
Here, you have some.

00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:28.738
Tasty, isn't it? Bon appétit.

00:07:29.907 --> 00:07:31.616
Now?

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.035
Now.

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:47.632
- Just pretend that l'm not here.
- l wanted to hit him at full speed.

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:52.929
- That's OK. We'll have some fun with him.
- Don't let them impale me. l wanna live.

00:07:53.014 --> 00:07:56.391
- Get off me.
- Come on, you're makin' a scene.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:59.436
We'll just take our furry piñata and go.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.439
lf it's not them today,
it's someone else tomorrow.

00:08:02.523 --> 00:08:04.983
Well, l'd rather it not be today. OK?

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:08.487
We'll break your neck
so you don't feel a thing.

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:11.656
Wait a minute. l thought
rhinos were vegetarians.

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.742
- An excellent point.
- Shut up.

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:17.496
Who says we're gonna eat him
after we kill him?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.540
l don't like animals that kill for pleasure.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:24.252
- Save it for a mammal that cares.
- l'm a mammal that cares.

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:29.466
OK, if either of you make it across that
sinkhole in front of ya, you get the sloth.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:33.386
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.

00:08:37.642 --> 00:08:41.269
- You were bluffing, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, that was a bluff.

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:43.980
Get him.

00:09:20.184 --> 00:09:22.310
A dandelion?

00:09:25.189 --> 00:09:27.315
We did it.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.452
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Get off my face.

00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:44.749
Whoa, we make a great team.
What do you say we head south together?

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.294
Great. Jump on my back
and relax the whole way.

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:49.379
- Wow, really?
- No.

00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:54.050
Wait, aren't you going south? The change
of seasons, migration instincts.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:56.761
- Any of this a-ringin' a bell?
- l guess not. Bye.

00:09:56.846 --> 00:10:00.390
OK, then. Thanks for the help.
l can take it from here.

00:10:00.808 --> 00:10:04.644
You overgrown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:09.149
That south thing is way overrated.
The heat, the crowds - who needs it?

00:10:09.233 --> 00:10:13.778
lsn't this great? You and me,
two bachelors knockin' about in the wild.

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:17.657
No, you just want a bodyguard so you
don't become somebody's side dish.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.118
You're a very shrewd mammal.

00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:23.288
OK, lead the way, Mr. Big...
Didn't get the name.

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:25.206
- Manfred.
- Manfred? Yuck.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:30.837
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?
Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...

00:10:33.132 --> 00:10:35.216
Stop following me.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:42.557
OK, so you've got issues. You won't
even know l'm here. l'll just zip the lip.

00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:30.772
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:36.194
lsn't it nice he'll be joining us
for breakfast?

00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:38.571
lt wouldn't be breakfast without him.

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:44.536
Especially since his daddy wiped out half
our pack and wears our skin to keep warm.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.622
An eye for an eye, don't you think?

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:51.376
Let's show him what happens
when he messes with sabers.

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.671
Alert the troops. We attack at dawn.

00:11:55.589 --> 00:12:00.385
And, Diego, bring me that baby alive.

00:12:00.469 --> 00:12:05.598
lf l'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
l want it to be fresh.

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:28.955
Phew. l'm wiped out.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.251
- That's your shelter?
- You're a big guy. You got a lotta wood.

00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:35.962
- l'm a little guy.
- You got half a stick.

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:42.218
But with my little stick and my highly
evolved brain, l shall create fire.

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:44.679
Fascinating.

00:12:45.055 --> 00:12:49.142
We'll see if brains triumph
over brawn tonight. Now, won't we?

00:12:55.316 --> 00:12:57.525
Think l saw a spark.

00:13:01.363 --> 00:13:04.908
Any chance l could squeeze
in there with you, Manny, ol' pal?

00:13:04.992 --> 00:13:07.619
lsn't there someone else you can annoy?

00:13:07.703 --> 00:13:11.456
Friends? Family? Poisonous reptiles?

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:16.252
My family abandoned me.
They just kinda migrated without me.

00:13:16.337 --> 00:13:18.880
You should see what they did last year.

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:21.883
They woke up early and
tied my hands and feet

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:24.761
and they gagged me with a field mouse,

00:13:24.845 --> 00:13:28.431
covered their tracks, went
through water so l'd lose their scent,

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:31.267
and... who needs 'em, anyway?

00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:38.483
So what about you? You have family?

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:45.949
OK, you're tired. l see.
We'll talk more in the morning.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.704
Manfred? Manfred?
Could you scooch over a drop?

00:13:52.748 --> 00:13:55.875
Come on. Nobody falls asleep that fast.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.086
Manny.

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:50.967
There's Diego. Fall back.

00:16:57.558 --> 00:17:00.393
- Where's the baby?
- l lost it over the falls.

00:17:00.644 --> 00:17:02.395
You lost it?

00:17:05.899 --> 00:17:08.568
- l want that baby, Diego.
- l'll get it.

00:17:08.652 --> 00:17:12.530
You'd better, unless you want to
serve as a replacement.

00:17:12.614 --> 00:17:15.908
We'll go up to Half Peak. Meet us there.

00:17:17.161 --> 00:17:19.245
lt had better be alive.

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:23.082
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:24.959
Let's go.

00:17:48.484 --> 00:17:52.403
She picked a hair off my shoulder and
says, "lf you have an extra mating dance,

00:17:52.488 --> 00:17:55.073
at least pick a female
with the same color pelt."

00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:58.409
l thought "Whoa. She's gonna go
praying mantis on me."

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:02.497
lf you find a mate, you should be loyal.
ln your case, grateful.

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:05.666
- Now get away from me.
- l think mating for life is stupid.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:08.336
There's plenty of Sid to go around.

00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:14.509
Manny?

00:19:07.354 --> 00:19:10.064
Look at that. He's OK.

00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:23.452
She's gone.

00:19:34.214 --> 00:19:37.592
- Manny, are you forgetting something?
- No.

00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:39.385
But you just saved him.

00:19:39.469 --> 00:19:42.221
l'm trying to get rid of
the last thing l saved.

00:19:42.306 --> 00:19:44.849
But you can't leave him here.

00:19:48.896 --> 00:19:52.440
Look, there's smoke.
That's his herd right up the hill.

00:19:52.649 --> 00:19:56.694
- We should return him.
- Let's get this straight. There is no "we."

00:19:56.778 --> 00:20:02.408
There never was a "we." ln fact, without
me, there wouldn't even be a "you."

00:20:03.285 --> 00:20:09.957
- Just up the hill.
- Listen very carefully: l'm not going.

00:20:10.417 --> 00:20:15.296
- Fine, be a jerk. l'll take care of him.
- Yeah, that's good.

00:20:15.422 --> 00:20:18.883
You can't even take care of yourself.
This, l gotta see.

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:23.054
l'll return you. We don't need
that meany-weeny mammoth, do we?

00:20:23.138 --> 00:20:25.306
No, we don't.

00:20:54.711 --> 00:20:58.130
You're an embarrassment to nature.
Do you know that?

00:20:58.632 --> 00:21:01.759
This is cake. l'm fine, l'm fine.

00:21:01.843 --> 00:21:03.636
l'm gonna die.

00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:19.110
Manny.

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:34.333
That pink thing is mine.

00:21:34.418 --> 00:21:36.919
No. Actually, that pink thing belongs to us.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.301
"Us"? You two are a bit of an odd couple.

00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:45.136
There is no "us."

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.556
l see. Can't have one of your own,
so you want to adopt.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.934
Look, l'm sorry to interrupt
your snack, but we gotta go.

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:55.354
The baby? Please.
l was returning him to his herd.

00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:57.732
Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.

00:21:57.816 --> 00:21:59.734
- Callin' me a liar?
- l didn't say that.

00:21:59.818 --> 00:22:01.944
You were thinkin' it.

00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:05.281
l don't like this cat. He reads minds.

00:22:05.365 --> 00:22:09.118
- Name's Diego, friend.
- Manfred, and l'm not your friend.

00:22:09.202 --> 00:22:11.537
Fine, Manfred.

00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:16.292
lf you're lookin' for the humans,
you're wastin' your time. They left.

00:22:16.376 --> 00:22:19.545
Thanks for the advice. Now beat it.

00:22:19.629 --> 00:22:23.632
l'll help you bring it to its herd,
but leave me alone after that.

00:22:23.717 --> 00:22:27.178
- OK. OK, deal. What's your problem?
- You are my problem.

00:22:27.262 --> 00:22:29.513
l think you're stressed,
so you eat too much.

00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:31.724
lt's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.

00:22:31.808 --> 00:22:35.936
l'm not fat. lt's all this fur.
lt makes me look poofy.

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:39.774
All right, you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, l'm here.

00:22:42.944 --> 00:22:46.405
What are you doin'?
Just drop it on the ledge.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:49.700
- We should make sure they found him.
- Good idea.

00:22:49.785 --> 00:22:52.286
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:54.455
Don't spear me.

00:22:57.709 --> 00:23:00.336
- This is a problem.
- Now what?

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:03.964
That's perfect.

00:23:34.454 --> 00:23:37.081
- l told you they were gone.
- Look who it is.

00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:39.750
Don't you have some
poor animal to disembowel?

00:23:39.835 --> 00:23:43.629
They couldn't be far. l mean,
they went this way, or this way?

00:23:43.713 --> 00:23:46.215
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?

00:23:46.299 --> 00:23:50.177
l'm a sloth. l see a tree,
eat a leaf. That's my tracking.

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:52.513
You didn't miss them by much.

00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:59.687
lt's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

00:24:02.816 --> 00:24:05.443
You don't need this aggravation.

00:24:06.403 --> 00:24:10.281
Give me the baby. l can
track humans down a lot faster than you.

00:24:10.365 --> 00:24:13.075
And you're just a good citizen helpin' out?

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.745
- l just know where the humans are going.
- Glacier Pass.

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:20.416
Everybody knows they have
a settlement on the other side.

00:24:21.334 --> 00:24:26.380
Unless you know how to track, you'll never
reach them before snow closes the pass.

00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:29.467
Which should be, like, tomorrow.

00:24:29.551 --> 00:24:35.389
So, you can give that baby to me,
or go get lost in a blizzard. lt's your choice.

00:24:42.105 --> 00:24:46.442
Here's your little bundle ofjoy.
We're returning it to the humans.

00:24:46.693 --> 00:24:51.989
The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind.
Poor tigey-wigey.

00:24:52.073 --> 00:24:55.159
Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way.

00:24:58.455 --> 00:25:01.207
Manny, can l talk to you for a second?

00:25:01.291 --> 00:25:06.128
No. The sooner we find the humans, the
sooner l get rid of Mr. Stinky Drool-Face,

00:25:06.213 --> 00:25:08.756
and the baby, too.

00:25:09.758 --> 00:25:12.510
You won't always have
Jumbo around to protect you.

00:25:12.594 --> 00:25:18.057
And when that day comes, l suggest you
watch your back, cos l'll be chewin' on it.

00:25:18.141 --> 00:25:22.019


00:25:22.103 --> 00:25:23.437
Help me.

00:25:39.454 --> 00:25:43.207
You gotta make it stop.
l can't take it anymore.

00:25:43.291 --> 00:25:47.419
- l've eaten things that complained less.
- He won't stop squirming.

00:25:47.504 --> 00:25:49.505
- Watch its head.
- Put it down.

00:25:49.589 --> 00:25:52.550
Jeez, "pick him up, put him down..."

00:25:52.634 --> 00:25:55.886
- lts nose is dry.
- That means something's wrong with it.

00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:58.806
- Someone should lick it. Just in case.
- l'll do it.

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:01.517
- He's wearing one of those baby thingies.
- So?

00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:04.395
So if he poops, where does it go?

00:26:06.523 --> 00:26:10.568
- Humans are disgusting.
- OK, you. Check for poop.

00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:13.696
- Why am l the poop-checker?
- Returning him was your idea,

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.700
you're small and insignificant,
and l'll pummel you if you don't.

00:26:17.784 --> 00:26:20.327
- Why else?
- Now, Sid.

00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:29.837
l mean, my goodness.
Look out. Coming through.

00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:32.715
- Watch out.
- Stop wavin' that thing around.

00:26:32.799 --> 00:26:34.675
l'm gonna slip.

00:26:39.347 --> 00:26:41.557
lt's clean. Got ya!

00:26:43.643 --> 00:26:45.728
Will you cut it out?

00:26:47.522 --> 00:26:50.316
Do that again. He likes it.

00:26:52.485 --> 00:26:54.903
lt's makin' me feel better too.

00:26:55.739 --> 00:26:57.906
Here, you hold it.

00:27:04.956 --> 00:27:06.540
Turn him towards me.

00:27:06.625 --> 00:27:08.917
Where is the baby?

00:27:09.711 --> 00:27:11.337
There he is.

00:27:12.213 --> 00:27:15.049
Where is the baby?

00:27:15.592 --> 00:27:18.344
There he is.

00:27:18.887 --> 00:27:21.347
Stop it. You're scarin' him.

00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:27.895
- l bet he's hungry.
- How about some milk?

00:27:27.979 --> 00:27:30.898
- l'd love some.
- Not you. The baby.

00:27:30.982 --> 00:27:33.734
l ain't exactly lactating right now, pal.

00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:36.779
- You're a little low on the food chain to...
- Enough.

00:27:36.863 --> 00:27:39.907
Enough, enough, enough.

00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:44.370
Food.

00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:57.049
l don't know, but l've been told

00:27:57.133 --> 00:28:01.512
End of the world be mighty cold

00:28:01.596 --> 00:28:04.139
Prepare for the ice age!

00:28:04.224 --> 00:28:06.684
Protect the dodo way of life!

00:28:06.768 --> 00:28:11.063
Survival separates the dodos
from the beasts!

00:28:12.315 --> 00:28:14.733
Protect the dodo way of life!

00:28:14.818 --> 00:28:17.111
Prepare for the ice age!

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:20.197
- lce age?
- l've heard of these crackpots.

00:28:23.159 --> 00:28:25.703
- lntruders.
- Now, don't fall in.

00:28:25.787 --> 00:28:29.790
- lf you do, you will definitely...
- lntruders. lntruder...

00:28:31.584 --> 00:28:33.460
...burn and die.

00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:37.715
Can we have our melon back?
Junior's hungry and...

00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:41.218
No way. This is our private
stockpile for the ice age.

00:28:41.302 --> 00:28:45.431
Subarctic temperatures will force us
underground for a billion years.

00:28:45.515 --> 00:28:47.641
So you got three melons?

00:28:49.102 --> 00:28:53.147
lf you weren't smart enough
to plan ahead, then doom on you.

00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:56.859
Doom on you. Doom on you. Doom on you.

00:28:56.943 --> 00:28:59.737
- Get away from me.
- Doom on you.

00:28:59.821 --> 00:29:01.780
Oh, no. No.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:06.076
Retrieve the melon.
Tae kwon dodos, attack.

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:21.467
- The melon.
- The melon, the melon, the melon...

00:29:23.178 --> 00:29:25.512
There goes our last female.

00:29:32.729 --> 00:29:35.814
- Got it, got it, got it.
- Don't got it.

00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:40.027
The last melon.

00:31:06.739 --> 00:31:09.825
Sid. Now we gotta find more food.

00:31:13.329 --> 00:31:17.332
Right, more to the right. Right, right, right.

00:31:17.417 --> 00:31:21.086
- Look at that. Dinner and a show.
- Left, left, left.

00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:30.846
Now to find a meal
befitting a conquering hero.

00:31:33.474 --> 00:31:37.102
What ho? A foe? Come on,
come on. You want a piece of me?

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.150
Spoils worthy of such a noble...

00:31:51.576 --> 00:31:53.660
Bedtime, squirt.

00:32:03.379 --> 00:32:05.297
The triumphant return.

00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:08.258
Huh? Oh, that.

00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:14.473
l'm so full. How about a good-night
kiss for your big buddy, Sid?

00:32:14.557 --> 00:32:17.643
- He's asleep.
- l was talking to you.

00:32:18.519 --> 00:32:20.604
Fine, l'll tuck myself in.

00:32:26.986 --> 00:32:29.780
All right, good night.

00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:55.013
Will you stop it?

00:32:55.098 --> 00:32:58.100
All right, all right. l was trying to relax.

00:33:03.564 --> 00:33:05.691
Oy.

00:33:53.823 --> 00:33:55.657
- What the... ?
- Slice me.

00:33:55.742 --> 00:33:57.075
lt'll be the last thing you ever do.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.912
- l'm workin' here, you waste of fur.
- Frustrated, Diego?

00:34:00.997 --> 00:34:03.957
Tracking down helpless infants
too difficult for you?

00:34:04.042 --> 00:34:08.211
- What are you two doin' here?
- Soto's getting tired of waiting.

00:34:08.296 --> 00:34:13.467
Yeah, he said "Come back with the baby,
or don't come back at all."

00:34:15.178 --> 00:34:17.471
l have a message for Soto.

00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:20.015
Tell him l'm bringing the baby.

00:34:21.309 --> 00:34:23.518
And tell him l'm bringing...

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.979
a mammoth.

00:34:26.064 --> 00:34:29.232
- A mammoth?
- Mammoths never travel alone.

00:34:29.317 --> 00:34:32.944
This one does,
and l'm leading him to Half Peak.

00:34:34.697 --> 00:34:36.990
Look at all that meat. Let's get him.

00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:41.244
Not yet. We'll need the whole pack
to bring this mammoth down.

00:34:41.329 --> 00:34:43.413
Get everyone ready.

00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:45.916
Now.

00:35:09.357 --> 00:35:12.526
- Where's the baby?
- You lost it?

00:35:14.112 --> 00:35:15.195
Sid.

00:35:16.197 --> 00:35:19.783
lt's so ugly. Positively adorable.

00:35:19.867 --> 00:35:23.745
Hello, pumpkin. Hello, little baldy bean.

00:35:24.038 --> 00:35:28.041
- Where'd you find it?
- The poor kid, all alone in the wild.

00:35:28.126 --> 00:35:30.377
Sabers were closing in on him.

00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:33.505
- So l just snatched him.
- So brave.

00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:38.135
Yeah, well, he needed me,
and l only wish l had one of my own, too.

00:35:38.219 --> 00:35:42.639
Really? l find that attractive in a male.

00:35:42.723 --> 00:35:46.059
Alas. Who wouldn't want
a family, l always say.

00:35:46.811 --> 00:35:50.438
- Where've you been hiding?
- Yeah, well, you know...

00:35:54.068 --> 00:35:57.863
Cute kid, huh? So, as l was saying, ladies...

00:36:00.116 --> 00:36:02.492
Hey. Hi, Manny.

00:36:03.077 --> 00:36:05.245
What's the matter with you?

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:10.250
Excuse me, ladies. You just keep
marinating and l'll be right back.

00:36:12.587 --> 00:36:14.379
Sexy.

00:36:15.256 --> 00:36:18.508
He's not much to look at,
but it's so hard to find a family guy.

00:36:18.593 --> 00:36:21.970
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.

00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:26.266
No, no, no. Manny, please,
l'm begging you. l need him.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.936
- A good-lookin' guy like you?
- You say that, but you don't mean it.

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:34.482
No, seriously. Look at you.
Those ladies, they don't stand a chance.

00:36:34.567 --> 00:36:37.903
- You have a cruel sense of humor.
- Don't let me cramp your style.

00:36:37.987 --> 00:36:41.156
- Thanks, Manny. You're a pal.
- Without Pinky.

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:43.533
Manny, l need him.

00:36:47.121 --> 00:36:50.123
So, ladies, where were we?

00:36:50.416 --> 00:36:53.084
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

00:36:55.963 --> 00:37:00.342
Pretty tail walks by, suddenly he moves
like a cheetah. And that tiger...

00:37:00.426 --> 00:37:04.054
Yeah, Mr. Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.

00:37:04.138 --> 00:37:08.308
What am l? The wet nurse?
What are you lookin' at, bone bag?

00:37:10.186 --> 00:37:13.939
Look at you. You're gonna
grow into a great predator.

00:37:14.482 --> 00:37:18.902
l don't think so. What have you got?
You got a little patch of fur.

00:37:18.986 --> 00:37:21.529
No fangs, no claws.

00:37:21.614 --> 00:37:25.075
You're folds of skin wrapped in mush.

00:37:25.159 --> 00:37:27.827
What's so threatening about you?

00:37:32.792 --> 00:37:35.835
Does this look like
a petting zoo to you? Huh?

00:37:39.006 --> 00:37:42.592
OK. All right, wise guy.
You just earned a time-out.

00:37:45.513 --> 00:37:48.515
You think that's funny? How about this?

00:37:50.685 --> 00:37:53.395
You'll be a little snack for the owls.

00:37:55.189 --> 00:37:58.358
You're a brave little squirt,
l'll give you that.

00:38:04.407 --> 00:38:09.202
Thank goodness. Thank goodness.
No. A tiger.

00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:11.663
Help. Help.

00:38:11.747 --> 00:38:14.124
- Where's the baby?
- Manfred has him.

00:38:14.208 --> 00:38:18.503
Just put me in your mouth.
Come on. Hurry up. He got me.

00:38:19.255 --> 00:38:20.380
Help.

00:38:20.464 --> 00:38:23.174
- Get away from me.
- lt went this way.

00:38:23.718 --> 00:38:25.135
Over here.

00:38:33.728 --> 00:38:36.313
Carl. The tiger beat us to him.

00:38:37.732 --> 00:38:40.025
Wait a minute.

00:38:45.406 --> 00:38:47.907
He's dead all right.

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:50.243
Carnivores have all the fun.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:56.875
Gosh, l hate breaking their hearts
like that. But you know how it is.

00:38:58.127 --> 00:39:01.004
All right, thanks.
You can put me down now.

00:39:01.422 --> 00:39:03.590
Manny. Manny.

00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:07.844
Guys, l thought we were in a hurry.
And Diego, spit that out.

00:39:07.928 --> 00:39:11.056
You don't know where it's been.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.893
Boy. For a second there,
l thought you were gonna eat me.

00:39:14.977 --> 00:39:18.188
- l don't eat junk food.
- Thought you were gonna...

00:39:18.272 --> 00:39:20.940
l thought you were gonna... Were you?

00:39:23.444 --> 00:39:28.365
Come on, wait up. Wait up. Come on,
come on. Can you wait a second, please?

00:39:28.449 --> 00:39:29.824
Fellas.

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:33.870
Thanks for waiting.

00:39:33.954 --> 00:39:36.706
Three, two, one...

00:39:39.627 --> 00:39:41.336
Sure is faithful.

00:39:56.435 --> 00:39:58.645
- Don't make me reach back.
- He started it.

00:39:58.729 --> 00:40:01.773
l don't care who started it. l'll finish it.

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:37.642
Modern architecture. lt'll never last.

00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:54.200
Hiya, Manny.

00:40:56.036 --> 00:40:58.288
Hi, Diego.

00:41:05.212 --> 00:41:07.255
Hey, Sid.

00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:11.468
- You're lost.
- No. l know exactly where we are.

00:41:11.552 --> 00:41:13.803
Ask him directions.

00:41:13.888 --> 00:41:16.764
- l don't need directions.
- Fine, l'll ask him.

00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:19.684
Buddy. You see any humans go by here?

00:41:23.063 --> 00:41:25.982
l love this game. l love this game. OK, OK.

00:41:26.066 --> 00:41:30.612
Three words. First word.
Stomp. No, no. Stamp, stamp.

00:41:30.696 --> 00:41:32.906
Let me try. Pack.

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:37.160
Good one, Manny.
Pack of long teeth and claws.

00:41:38.662 --> 00:41:40.622
Pack of wolves? Pack of...

00:41:40.706 --> 00:41:43.500
Pack of bears? Pack of fleas?

00:41:43.584 --> 00:41:46.002
Pack of whiskers? Pack of noses?

00:41:46.086 --> 00:41:48.338
- Pachyderm?
- Pack of lies.

00:41:48.422 --> 00:41:51.508
Pack of troubles. Pack a wallop.
Pack of birds.

00:41:51.592 --> 00:41:53.259
Pack of flying fish.

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:45.186
Great news. l found a shortcut.

00:42:48.148 --> 00:42:52.235
- What do you mean, shortcut?
- l mean faster than the long way around.

00:42:52.736 --> 00:42:54.737
l know what a shortcut is.

00:42:54.822 --> 00:43:00.201
Either we beat the humans to Glacier Pass
or we take the long way and miss 'em.

00:43:00.286 --> 00:43:03.663
Through there? What do you take me for?

00:43:03.747 --> 00:43:07.166
This time tomorrow,
you could be a free mammoth.

00:43:07.668 --> 00:43:10.420
Or a nanny. l never get tired of peekaboo.

00:43:10.504 --> 00:43:13.047
Guys. Guys. Check this out.

00:43:15.759 --> 00:43:18.261
Sid, the tiger found a shortcut.

00:43:20.556 --> 00:43:22.682
No, thanks. l choose life.

00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:25.435
Then l suggest you take the shortcut.

00:43:25.519 --> 00:43:28.521
- Are you threatening me?
- Move, sloth!

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.070
Way to go, tiger.

00:43:36.697 --> 00:43:38.573
Quick. Get inside.

00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:04.766
OK, l vote shortcut.

00:44:19.281 --> 00:44:22.950
Guys, stick together.
lt's easy to get lost in here.

00:44:38.592 --> 00:44:40.593
Guys?

00:44:57.903 --> 00:44:59.696
A fish.

00:45:42.406 --> 00:45:46.576
Will you keep up, please?
Hard enough to keep track of one baby.

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:33.873
l gotcha.

00:46:50.432 --> 00:46:52.600
Captain, iceberg ahead.

00:46:59.399 --> 00:47:00.650
Oh, no.

00:47:52.911 --> 00:47:55.162
Yeah. Who's up for round two?

00:47:59.585 --> 00:48:01.961
Tell the kid to be more careful.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.588
Look, look. Tigers.

00:48:47.883 --> 00:48:52.637
No, it's OK, it's OK. Look, the tigers
are just playing tag with the antelope.

00:48:54.681 --> 00:48:59.185
- With their teeth.
- Come on, Sid, let's play tag.

00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:00.895
You're it.

00:49:02.481 --> 00:49:05.733
Sure. OK, OK, OK, where are the sloths?

00:49:05.817 --> 00:49:08.778
You never see any sloths.
Have you ever noticed?

00:49:08.862 --> 00:49:12.406
- Look, Manny, a mammoth.
- Somebody pinch me.

00:49:12.491 --> 00:49:15.618
Hey, hey, this fat one looks just like you.

00:49:16.495 --> 00:49:18.788
And he's got a family.

00:49:18.872 --> 00:49:22.291
And he's happy.
Look, he's playing with his kid.

00:49:22.376 --> 00:49:26.128
See? That's your problem. That's what
mammoths are supposed to do.

00:49:26.213 --> 00:49:27.755
- Sid...
- Find a she-mmoth,

00:49:27.839 --> 00:49:28.923
have baby mammoths...

00:49:29.007 --> 00:49:30.549
- Sid.
- What?

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:32.635
- Shut up.
- But...

00:53:00.468 --> 00:53:02.678
Would you look at that.

00:53:02.762 --> 00:53:05.848
The tiger actually did it. There's Half Peak.

00:53:05.932 --> 00:53:08.517
Next stop, Glacier Pass.

00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:12.688
- How could l ever have doubted you?
- Did you hear that, little fella?

00:53:12.772 --> 00:53:14.899
You're almost home.

00:53:19.613 --> 00:53:22.114
- My feet are sweating.
- Do we need a news flash

00:53:22.199 --> 00:53:25.618
- every time your body does something?
- lgnore him.

00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:28.913
Seriously. My feet are really hot.

00:53:34.669 --> 00:53:36.921
Tell me that was your stomach.

00:53:37.005 --> 00:53:39.423
l'm sure it was just thunder.

00:53:39.507 --> 00:53:42.426
From underground?

00:54:02.781 --> 00:54:04.823
Come on, keep up with me.

00:54:04.908 --> 00:54:07.284
l would if you were moving.

00:54:10.205 --> 00:54:13.415
- l wish l could jump like that.
- Wish granted.

00:54:17.712 --> 00:54:21.799
- Come on, move faster.
- Have you noticed the river of lava?

00:54:41.194 --> 00:54:42.861
Hold Pinky.

00:55:14.728 --> 00:55:16.603
Manny.

00:55:28.616 --> 00:55:30.200
Manny, Manny, Manny, you OK?

00:55:30.285 --> 00:55:33.287
Come on, come on, say something.
Anything.

00:55:35.582 --> 00:55:37.750
What? What? l can't hear you.

00:55:37.834 --> 00:55:40.085
You're standing on my trunk.

00:55:42.088 --> 00:55:45.591
- You're OK. You're OK.
- Why did you do that?

00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:48.761
You could have died, trying to save me.

00:55:48.845 --> 00:55:51.430
That's what you do in a herd.

00:55:51.514 --> 00:55:53.766
You look out for each other.

00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:56.185
Well, thanks.

00:55:58.229 --> 00:56:02.816
l don't know about you guys, but we
are the weirdest herd l've ever seen.

00:56:21.294 --> 00:56:24.296
l can't wait to get
my claws in that mammoth.

00:56:24.381 --> 00:56:28.175
No one touches the mammoth
until l get that baby.

00:56:31.012 --> 00:56:34.181
First, l'll slice its hindquarters
into sections.

00:56:34.265 --> 00:56:38.477
- l'll put the white meat in one pile and...
- Knock it off. l'm starving.

00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:42.272
Next, the shoulders. Occasionally
tough, but extremely juicy.

00:56:42.357 --> 00:56:45.567
- l told you to knock it off.
- Save your energy.

00:56:45.652 --> 00:56:48.320
Mammoths don't go down easy.

00:56:48.988 --> 00:56:51.365
There's only one way to do it.

00:56:51.449 --> 00:56:54.576
First, you have to force it into a corner.

00:56:54.661 --> 00:56:58.705
Cut off its retreat.
And when you three have it trapped,

00:56:58.790 --> 00:57:00.916
l'll go for the throat.

00:57:10.927 --> 00:57:13.887
Guys, we gotta get this kid outta the wind.

00:57:17.976 --> 00:57:20.269
- How much further?
- Three miles.

00:57:20.353 --> 00:57:23.772
l'm beat. We'll get there in the morning.

00:57:26.818 --> 00:57:30.487
- What are you doin'?
- l'm putting sloths on the map.

00:57:33.408 --> 00:57:36.618
Why don't you make it realistic
and draw him lying down?

00:57:36.703 --> 00:57:38.787
And make him rounder.

00:57:41.249 --> 00:57:45.043
- Perfect.
- l forgot how to laugh.

00:57:52.552 --> 00:57:54.386
l'm a genius.

00:57:58.224 --> 00:58:03.145
From now on you'll have to
refer to me as Sid, Lord of the Flame.

00:58:03.229 --> 00:58:06.690
Lord of the Flame, your tail's on fire.

00:58:14.949 --> 00:58:18.785
Thank you. From now on,
l'm gonna call you Diego.

00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:21.288
Lord of "Touch Me and You're Dead".

00:58:21.372 --> 00:58:24.500
l'm just kiddin', you little knucklehead.

00:58:24.918 --> 00:58:27.127
Lovebirds.

00:58:27.212 --> 00:58:29.254
Look at this.

00:58:33.134 --> 00:58:35.260
l don't believe it.

00:58:48.775 --> 00:58:53.820
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy-worm.

00:58:53.905 --> 00:58:56.031
Come to Uncle Sid.

00:58:56.115 --> 00:58:59.159
No, no, no, no, no, no. This way. This way.

00:59:00.203 --> 00:59:02.913
No, no, no. No, go to him.

00:59:04.123 --> 00:59:06.208
Go to him.

00:59:08.628 --> 00:59:09.920
OK.

00:59:11.172 --> 00:59:14.883
Good job. Keep practicin'.

00:59:17.971 --> 00:59:21.139
Look at that. Our little guy is growing up.

00:59:23.601 --> 00:59:26.645
All right, come on. Sleep time, lumpy.

00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:34.194
Look at that big pushover.

00:59:35.822 --> 00:59:40.450
You know, Diego, l've never had
a friend who would risk his life for me.

00:59:40.535 --> 00:59:44.621
Yeah, Manny's... he's a good guy.

00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:47.249
Yeah, he is.

00:59:48.126 --> 00:59:50.586
Well, good night.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:28.123
Let's get you all cleaned up. What's your
daddy gonna say if you go back all stinky?

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.961
Let me just clean that up.
That looks good. A little bit here.

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:36.965
- You clean up nice, little fella.
- l think he's starting to look like me.

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.176
Diego, what do you think?

01:00:40.803 --> 01:00:43.138
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

01:00:43.222 --> 01:00:47.225
lf we save him, he'll be a hunter.
And who do you think he'll hunt?

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:49.645
Maybe because we save him,
he won't hunt us.

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:54.274
Yeah, and maybe he'll grow fur and
a long skinny neck and call you Mama.

01:00:54.942 --> 01:01:00.322
- What's your problem?
- Nothing. Let's go. l'm freezing my tail off.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:21.885
Diego. You frozen back there?

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:28.183
- Get down.
- What?

01:01:28.267 --> 01:01:30.519
- Get down and follow me.
- What's goin' on?

01:01:30.603 --> 01:01:35.565
At the bottom of Half Peak,
there's an ambush waiting for you.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.402
- What?
- What do you mean, "ambush"?

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:42.364
- You set us up.
- lt was my job.

01:01:42.448 --> 01:01:46.034
- l was to get the baby, but then...
- You brought us home for dinner.

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:48.870
- That's it. You're out of the herd.
- l'm sorry.

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:51.206
No, you're not. Not yet.

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:55.043
- Listen, l can help you.
- Stay close, Sid. We can fight our way out.

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:58.255
You can't. The pack's too strong.
You have to trust me.

01:01:58.339 --> 01:02:01.633
Trust you? Why in the world
would we trust you?

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:04.052
Because l'm your only chance.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.484
Hello, ladies.

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:22.529
Look who decided to show up.

01:02:22.613 --> 01:02:25.907
Diego, l was beginning to worry about you.

01:02:25.992 --> 01:02:32.289
No need to worry. ln about two minutes
you'll be satisfying your taste for revenge.

01:02:32.373 --> 01:02:34.249
Very nice.

01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:37.544
l see the sloth. And he's got the baby.

01:02:37.628 --> 01:02:40.422
Don't give away your positions
until you see the mammoth.

01:02:40.506 --> 01:02:42.966
He's the one to surprise.

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:46.678
You want to maul something, don't you?

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:50.265
- l wanna maul.
- Then what are you waiting for?

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:56.188
No, l said wait for the mammoth.

01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:21.046
Backscratcher. Eat my powder!

01:03:36.854 --> 01:03:38.730
Loop-de-loop.

01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:41.942
Slalom! Slalom, baby!

01:04:07.635 --> 01:04:11.513
Sorry, fellas. He got a little frostbite.

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:14.766
Get him.

01:04:18.145 --> 01:04:20.272
Surprise!

01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:29.865
OK, follow me. We'll pick up Sid
and get outta here while we can.

01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:33.910
Come on, Diego,
let's bring this mammoth down.

01:04:46.173 --> 01:04:47.674
There he is.

01:04:50.595 --> 01:04:53.013
That's right. Where's the baby?

01:04:56.893 --> 01:05:00.145
Survival of the fittest.

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:03.064
l don't think so. Yeah.

01:05:14.327 --> 01:05:18.747
- What are you doing?
- Leave the mammoth alone.

01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:24.711
Fine. l'll take you down first.

01:06:40.746 --> 01:06:42.872
We did it.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.346
We were some team, huh?

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:02.475
Were? Come on, we're still a team.

01:07:02.977 --> 01:07:05.478
l'm sorry l set you up.

01:07:05.938 --> 01:07:08.898
You know me -
l'm too lazy to hold a grudge.

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:14.237
Knock it off, squirt.

01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:17.323
You gotta be strong.

01:07:17.658 --> 01:07:20.994
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.

01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:23.913
Especially Sid.

01:07:23.998 --> 01:07:27.917
Come on, you can lick this. You're a tiger.

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:31.046
Look, l'll carry you.
Come on, what do you say?

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:33.590
Come on, Diego, come on.

01:07:33.674 --> 01:07:36.301
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.

01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:41.097
Listen, you have to leave me here.

01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:45.143
lf those humans get through the pass,
you'll never catch them.

01:07:45.978 --> 01:07:48.188
You didn't have to do that.

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:51.983
That's what you do in a herd.

01:11:07.638 --> 01:11:09.764
Don't forget about us.

01:11:09.848 --> 01:11:11.933
OK?

01:11:14.019 --> 01:11:16.479
We won't forget about you.

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.063
Goodbye.

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:01.607
Goodbye. Goodbye.

01:12:01.692 --> 01:12:04.068
- Sid...
- Bye.

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:07.405
Bye.

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:12.827
That's right. Where's the baby?

01:12:12.911 --> 01:12:15.413
Come on, Sid, let's head south.

01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.391
Bye.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:40.021
Save your breath, Sid.
You know humans can't talk.

01:12:40.481 --> 01:12:42.690
Diego? You're OK.

01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:45.943
- Nine lives, baby.
- You're OK.

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:47.779
You're OK.

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:50.907
l could kiss ya.

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.827
Welcome back, partner. Wanna lift?

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:57.914
No thanks. l gotta save
whatever dignity l've got left.

01:12:57.998 --> 01:13:02.543
You're hanging out with us. Dignity's
got nothing to do with it. l'll take that lift.

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:05.129
