/**
 * Removes unsupported playlists from each provided VHS-formatted manifest object. The
 * checks to determine support include:
 *
 * - Presence of both audio and video in the playlists (audio only and video only are not
 *   currently supported), either as muxed or demuxed (via a default alt audio playlist)
 * - Video codecs supported by the browser's MSE (media source extensions) implementation
 *
 * Note that these checks do not guarantee a successful concatenation operation. Limited
 * availability of information (e.g., no codec info for media manifests), and a lack of
 * checks for compatibility between manifests, may result in an unsuccessful concatenation
 * operation. These are rarer cases though, and should be handled by the user.
 *
 * @param {Object[]} manifestObjects
 *        An array of (master or media) manifest objects (in the format used by VHS)
 *
 * @return {Object[]}
 *          An array of arrays containing supported playlists from each manifest object
